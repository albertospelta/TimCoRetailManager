## Creating a WebAPI with Authentication - [PR #1](https://github.com/albertospelta/TimCoRetailManager/pull/1)
* Set up a C# WebAPI project with authentication and test out the authentication and authorization process.

## Configuring Swagger in WebAPI - [PR #2](https://github.com/albertospelta/TimCoRetailManager/pull/2)
* Set up Swagger to document and demonstrate API's capabilities in an easy-to-use web interface. 
* See how we wire up our bearer token authentication so that we can have endpoints secured with OAuth and yet still use the "Try It Now" buttons in Swagger.
